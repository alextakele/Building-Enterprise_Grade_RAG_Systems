# Developing RAG based LLM Applications for Enterprise 

In this project , I am  Developing RAG based LLM Applications for Enterprise :
- Automatic Prompt Generation Service
- Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service
- Prompt Testing and Ranking Service
- Scale the major components (load, chunk, embed, index) in our application.
## Overview
Large language models (LLMs) have undoubtedly changed the way we interact with information. However, they come with their fair share of limitations as to what we can ask of them. Base LLMs (ex. Llama-2-70b, gpt-4, etc.) are only aware of the information that they've been trained on and will fall short when we require them to know information beyond that. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based LLM applications address this exact issue and extend the utility of LLMs and their generative reasoning abilities to our unique datasets.

In this Project, we're going to build a RAG-based LLM application where we will incorporate external data sources to augment our LLM’s capabilities.
